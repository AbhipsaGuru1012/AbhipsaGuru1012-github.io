        <h2>Key Takeaways From This Lockdown</h2>
        <p class="special">
            This coronavirus situation and the lockdown that came with it were completely unprecedented. It has been really hard ever since to adapt with this new way of life. No one would have thought that a virus could cause such nuisance and bring dramatical changes to the economy and put a stop to our everyday activities.

        <p>
            To get rid of the boredom, we have tried to engage ourselves with a lot of new activities. One thing I know for sure is that the lockdown has taught us a lot of new stuff and has made us appreciate the little things in our lives. It has given us a break from our monotonous lifestyle that at some point we all had wished for.

            Here are some key takeaways from the lockdown:

        </p>
        <p>
            1) We won't take for granted our time spent travelling and moving around -
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            Remember the last time you had the privilege to travel or visited a place you always wanted to visit or simply when you lay on the grass on a sunny afternoon? I am using the word 'privilege' because now it seems like an eternity away, far from reality. Now we are reminiscing the days when we were free to travel around. So the next time you spend your day out, please be more thankful and live in the moment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            2) We will be more grateful of the times spent with our friends and close ones -
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            If I ask anyone one thing they miss a lot in the lockdown the answer will unanimously be hanging out with friends. The last time you bid goodbye to your friends you wouldn’t have thought that you will be meeting them after such a long time. This lockdown has made us realize that we miss the gossips and the places we used to hangout at, and the fun we had in a group, together, that is irreplaceable. Now we are all busy planning is our next meet-up or trip with our friends.
            <br>
            <br>
            3) Spending quality time with family -
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The only good thing about this lockdown is that we got to spend some good time with our family. May it be playing board games or trying your hand at cooking with your mom, everything feels rejuvenating. Going through the 'old photo album' (lying in a dusty condition in every house) of the family and revisting the memories made us nostalgic. We have become more expressive and have bonded really well lately with our family. Also there weren’t any 'Monday Blues' throughout this period, all thanks to lockdown. :)
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            All in all, this lockdown has been a difficult time for many. But this experience will stay with us forever. We will be more grateful than ever for everything in life instead of cribbing about small things. One of the many things this lockdown has taught is to "Stop, Stare and Live every moment to the fullest".
